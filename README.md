# Ad-hoc Data Analysis :
The Czechoslovakia Bank wants to analyse its financial data to gain insights and make informed decisions. The bank needs to identify trends, patterns, and potential risks in its financial operations. They also want to explore the possibility of introducing new financial products or services based on their analysis.

 The bank has identified the following questions as important for their analysis:
 - What factors influence the probability of loan approval by bank customers?
 - What types of cards are most often used by the bank's customers?
 - Which districts have the largest number of loans and is this related to the economic performance of the district?
 - What are the main expenses of the bank and how can they be reduced to increase profitability?
 - What is the bank's loan portfolio and how does it vary depending on the goals and customer segments?
